vim-gcovered
============

A small plugin for vim that provides syntax highlighting for the output of the gcc profiling tool, gcov.
This allows for quick review of code coverage so you can obtain those juicy one hundreds.
This piggybacks on top of your regular C/C++ highlighting so it actually doesn't do very much.

Installation
------------

To install with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) simply add the following to your `.vimrc`

    Plugin 'hamsterjam/vim-gcovered'

Then run `:PluginInstall`.
